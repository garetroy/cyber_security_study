# Classificaiton of Security Threats
 - Internal vs External
 - Level of Sophistication/Capability
 - Resources / Funding
 - Intent / Motivation

# Threat Actor
 - Unskilled - Individuals that are sometimes called "Script Kiddies". 
   - Has little knowledge of how the exploits work, typically has low resource.
 - Hacktivists - Individuals or groups that use techniques to achieve their (political) goals. 
   - Skills levels vary.
   - Typically low resources (sometimes they have a lot (anon)).
   - Whistleblowers fall into this category.
 - Orginized Crime - Groups typically focused on finanical gain.
   - They like to stay in the shadows.
   - Typically medium to high skill.
   - Have high resources.
 - Nation States - Foreign governments or entities.
   - Highly skilled.
   - High resources.
   - APTs (Advanced persistent threats).
 - Insiders - Individuals with authorized access to systems.
   - Any skill with different motivations and resources.
   - Can be a disgruntled employee.
 - Competitors - Business v Business
   - Corprate Espionage
   - Varies highly in resources and skills.

# Attack Motivations
 - Data Exfil - Gain sensitive or proprietary information.
 - Espionage - Gain secret Knowledge.
 - Service Disruption
 - Blackmail
 - Finanical Gain
 - Philosophical or Political Beliefs
 - Chaos
 - War

# Threat Vectors & Attack Surfaces
 - Attack Surface - System, Service, or Application to exploit.
   - First step for an attack is identification of the Attack Surface.
 - Threat Vector - Means that actors use to launch an attack.
   - Using a Threat Vector on an Attack Surface.
 - Example Vectors
   - Message Based (email, im)
   - Wired Network (on location)
   - Wireless Network (wifi, bluetooth)
   - Systems (software, OS)
   - Files (Malicious Code embeded in images)
   - Removable Devices (usb)
   - Cloud (flaws in permission design or leaked passwords)
   - Supply Chain (tampering at the provider level)

# Threat Data & Intelligence
 - Threat Intelligence - Set of activites & resources available to cyber security professionals.
   - Public or Private
   - Can be used for predictive analysis
 - Vulnerability Databases - A collection of currently know vulnerabilites.
 - Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) - Telltale signs an attack has taken place.
 - Open Source Intelligence - Public Threat Intelligence.
 - Threat Maps - Geographic views of Threat Intelligence.
 - Assessing Threat Intel Value
   - Is it timley?
   - Is it accurate?
   - Is it relevant?
   - Confidence scores is one way of evaluation.
 - Threat indicator and management is so large, it requires standards.
   - STIX is the request/response structure
   - TAXII is the protocol
