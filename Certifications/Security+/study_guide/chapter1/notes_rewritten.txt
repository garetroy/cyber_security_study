# CIA Triad
 - Cyber security has three key objectives called the CIA triad.
 - Confidentiality - Ensures unauthorized individuals are unable to gain access to sensitive information
 - Integrity - No unauthorized modificaitons to the data; intentionally or unintentionally.
 - Availablility - Ensures information and systems are read to meet the needs of the users @ request time. 
 - Nonrepudations - Ability to confirm the actions of an individual (e.g. they are unable to say they never sent a message)
   - This is not apart of CIA but closely related to.

# Data Breach Risks
 - Security incedents when the customer experiences a problem in any of the CIA Triad axises.
 - Can be by attackers or by incidentals such as losing a device or an earthquake destorying data centrs.

# DAD Triad
 - The tree threats to cyber security, which are related to the CIA triad.
 - Disclosure - Exposure of sensitive information; aka Data Loss. 
   - Violation of Confidentiality axis.
   - Data Exfiltration - Attacker gains information and removes it from the source.
 - Alteration - Modification of information.
   - Violation of the Integrity axis.
 - Denial - Disruption of access to data.
   - Violates the Availability axis.

# Breach Impact
 - Risk analysis that allows us to identify the potential or actual impact of an event.
 - Finanical Risk, which can include direct (lost of laptop) or indirect (the ideas that existed on the laptop are not recoverable).
 - Reputational Risk
 - Stratigic Risk - Prevents the customer from reaching important strategic goals (x$ by Q2).
 - Operational Risk - Ability to carry out daya to day function (less serious than Stratigic).
 - Compliance Risk - Legal or policy rammifications.

# Security Controls
 - Control Objectives - Statments that define the state of security that is desired.
 - Security Controls - The actual mechanisims employed to attain Control Objectives.
 - Gap Analysis - Review done to identify the descrepency between the Control Objectives and the current (or planned) Security Controls in place.

## Securiy Control Categories
 - Technical - Digital controls, software or hardware.
   - Firewalls
   - ACL's
   - Encryption
 - Operational - People as a means of control.
   - User Access Reviews
   - Persons Log Monitoring
   - Security Gaurds
 - Managerial - Mechanisms of the Risk Management process.
   - Security Planning Exercises
   - Security Reviews
   - Alteration of (execution of) Control Objectives
 - Physical 
   - Fences
   - Locks
   - Lighting

## Security Control Types
 - Preventative - Stopping before the event occurs.
   - Firewalls
 - Deterent - Makes the event less likley.
   - Dogs
 - Detective - Identify events that already happened.
   - Logs/Alerts
 - Corrective - Remediation of problems
   - Restoring Backups
 - Compensative - Mitigation of Problem.
   - Blocking an upgrade
 - Directive - Informative actions taken by others.
   - Rules for opening emails

# Data Protection
 - There are three states of data
   - Data at Rest - Storage phase of data (HDDs)
   - Data in Transit - Data that exists within communication (networking) 
   - Data in use - Data that exists within the system (RAM)
 - Data Loss Prevention (DLP) - Systems that help orginize around prevention such as searching for unsecured data or attempts to login
   - Agent Based DLP Environment - Installed Monitoring Software
   - Agentless " " - Dedicated devices that sit on the network and monitor traffic. 
   - DLPs might auto encrypt sensitive information it finds
   - DLPs can use pattern matcing or watermarking (DRM) to identify information.

# Data Minimizaiton
 - Reducing the amount of sensitive data monitored.
 - Can take the form of depulication
 - Data Obfuscation
   - Hashing (One way transformation)
   - Tokenizaiton (ID 1818 = Garett)
   - Masking (password = "*****"
