1. **Which of the following is an example of a compensating control?**  
   - A) Redundant power supplies  
   - B) Antivirus software  
   - C) Data encryption  
   - D) Two-factor authentication  

   _Your Answer: A) Redundant power supplies_  
   _Correct Answer: D) Two-factor authentication_  
   _Explanation:_ A compensating control is an alternative security measure used when the primary control is not feasible. Two-factor authentication can be used as a compensating control when a more complex solution is not possible.

2. **What is the primary purpose of a digital signature?**  
   - A) Ensure confidentiality  
   - B) Provide non-repudiation  
   - C) Compress data  
   - D) Speed up encryption  

   _Answered Correctly: B) Provide non-repudiation_  
   _Explanation:_ Digital signatures provide non-repudiation, ensuring that the sender cannot deny having sent a message.

3. **Which security principle is most closely associated with ensuring that data is only accessible by authorized users?**  
   - A) Integrity  
   - B) Confidentiality  
   - C) Availability  
   - D) Non-repudiation  

   _Answered Correctly: B) Confidentiality_  
   _Explanation:_ Confidentiality ensures that information is only accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

4. **Which of the following is a characteristic of Zero Trust?**  
   - A) Implicit trust within the network  
   - B) Trust but verify  
   - C) Least privilege access  
   - D) Open access to all users  

   _Answered Correctly: C) Least privilege access_  
   _Explanation:_ Zero Trust focuses on verifying every request as though it originates from an open network, using least privilege access to limit what users and devices can access.

5. **What does a security information and event management (SIEM) system primarily help with?**  
   - A) Data encryption  
   - B) Logging and alerting  
   - C) Physical security  
   - D) Software development  

   _Answered Correctly: B) Logging and alerting_  
   _Explanation:_ SIEM systems collect, analyze, and alert on security events, helping to identify and respond to potential security threats.

6. **Which method is used to verify the integrity of a message?**  
   - A) Encryption  
   - B) Hashing  
   - C) Steganography  
   - D) Authentication  

   _Answered Correctly: B) Hashing_  
   _Explanation:_ Hashing generates a fixed-size string of characters from input data, ensuring that any change to the data results in a different hash.

7. **What is a key benefit of using multifactor authentication (MFA)?**  
   - A) Reduces network traffic  
   - B) Increases user convenience  
   - C) Provides better data compression  
   - D) Enhances security by requiring multiple credentials  

   _Answered Correctly: D) Enhances security by requiring multiple credentials_  
   _Explanation:_ MFA improves security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access.

---

8. **Which type of control is a firewall?**  
   - A) Physical  
   - B) Administrative  
   - C) Technical  
   - D) Compensating  

   _Answered Correctly: C) Technical_  
   _Explanation:_ Firewalls are technical controls used to enforce security policies by monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic.

---

9. **What is an example of a deterrent control?**  
   - A) Encryption  
   - B) Security guards  
   - C) Disaster recovery plan  
   - D) Antivirus software  

   _Answered Correctly: B) Security guards_  
   _Explanation:_ Deterrent controls aim to discourage attackers. Security guards act as a physical deterrent by providing visible security presence.

---

10. **Which hashing algorithm is considered more secure for cryptographic use: MD5 or SHA-256?**  
    - A) MD5  
    - B) SHA-256  
    - C) Both are equally secure  
    - D) Neither is secure  

    _Answered Correctly: B) SHA-256_  
    _Explanation:_ SHA-256 is more secure than MD5, as MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, making it unsuitable for cryptographic purposes.
