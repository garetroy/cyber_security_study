# Security Concepts
 - CIA Triad (sometimes known as AIC)
 - Confidentiality - Information only available to the right people
   - Encryption
   - ACLs
   - Two factor authentication
 - Integrity - Data is stored or transferred as intended
   - Modification of data is identified
   - Hashing
   - Digital Signatures
   - Certificates
   - Non-repudation
 - Availability - Data is accessible to authorized users
   - Redundancy 
   - Fault Tolerence
   - Patching
 - Non-repudation - Verifiable acitons by actors
   - e.g. You send an email, but delete the email, the orginization can still identify that you took that action
 - Proof of Integrity - Verifies that the data did not change
   - We can use hashing for this
 - Proof of Origin - Prove the source/author of the message.
   - Matches individuals signature
   - SSh keys

## Authentication, Authorization, & Accounting
 - Identification - Who you claim to be
 - Authentication - Proving of that identity
 - Authorization - Based on that authorization, what access is given.
 - Accounting - Recoring of the activites (who/what/when/where)
 - Client -> internet -> firewall -> AAA Server -> Firewall -> Data Server
 - Autherization for a device is typically done by putting a certificate on the device via mgmt software.
   - Certificate Authority (CA)
 - Authorization models are how we idnetify permissions 
   - Typically User/service to data & application access

## Gap Analysis
 - Helps us to identify the discrepency of current security controls to the desired.
 - Can be brief or a study done over years.
 - Create a baseline first
   - ISO/IEC 27001
 - Evaluate people
   - Formal Experience
   - Current Training
 - Compare and Contrast
   - Evaluate the current system
   - Identify weaknesses
   - Breakdown into smaller segments
 - Final Analysis
 - Suggestions to close gaps

## Zero Trust
 - Many networks trust individuals that get access to the internal network.
 - Zero Trust - Nothing is trusted and all is subject to security checks.
 - Functional Plans - different layers of a network for control
   - Data Plane
   - Control Plane (Manages actions, defines policies, how ports are forwarded...etc)
 - Adaptive Identity - Apply security controls not just on the identity of the individual, but looks at other attributes such as locatoin, type of connection, ... etc)
 - Threat Score Reduction - Decreasing the possibilities of who is allowed
 - Policy driven access control - Combinded tyypically with Adaptive Identity
 - Secuirty Zones - Identifying origin to destination connections (where they are coming from and where they are going)
   - This allows there to be rules of access between different planes/zones.
 - Policy Enforcement Point - The point of policy evaluation that traffic first has to go through.
   - Typically also gains information on the request, but does not decide.
 - Policy Decision Point - Uses PEP data to make a decision on the requests permission. (Exists within the PEP or in tandem with)
 - Policy Administrator - With PEP informations, generates access tokens or credintails. 

## Physical Security 
 - Preventing Access
 - Baracades
 - Access Control Vestibule - Think of access to certain areas through hallways... etc

## Deception & Disruption
 - Honey Pot - Attracts attackers to attack on a mock environment, which typically allows for recon.
 - Honey Nets - Larger networked Honey Pots
 - Honey Files - Files that look attractive 
   - Alerts placed on access of a file.
 - Honey Token - Traceable data so you can follow the attacker
   - Api Credentials
   - Emails
   - Cookies
