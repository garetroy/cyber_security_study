# Change Management
 - Identifies how to make a change
 - One change can lead to massive downstream changes

## Change Control Process
 - A document that provides details how to introduce changes or implementations.
 - Typically helps avoid downtime, confusion, or mistakes
 - Typical Approval Process
   - Defining Request Forms
   - Determining the Purpose of the Change
   - Identifying the scope of the change
   - Scheduling date and time of the change
   - Determining what is going to be effected
   - Analyze the risk associated w/ the change
   - Get end-user acceptence 
 - Usually the change come from the owner of the data/application
   - E.x. shipping labels need to be updated
 - Stakeholders - Individuals/Departements that are effected or invested in the change.
 - Impact Analysis - Determining the risk value
   - Can be mild or far reaching
   - Fix can break another component
   - The fix could actually do nothing
   - Could cause Data Corruption
   - ... etc
 - Also important to identify the risk for not updating
   - Vulnerability
   - Unexpected Downtime
   - Application unavailability
 - Testing
   - Testing can help with verifying the expected behavior of the change
   - Sandbox environment can help a lot
 - Backout Plan - A plan that will identify the best way to rever the changes
   - Not everything is revertable
   - Maybe test it within the sandbox environment
 - Maintence Window - When the change will happen
   - Typically happens outside peak hours (unless an emergency)
   - Code freeze
   - Mitigates the amount of processes/people effected

## Technical Change Management
 - This is the "how" to make changes
 - Allow list/deny list
   - Allow list is more flexible
 - A change approval isnt permisison to make any change
 - Though sometmes it is requried to make changes outside of the change, so long as the change is documented (and the scope of this is sometimes defined within CCP)
 - Downtime Announcments
 - May require restarts of services/computers/servers
 - Legacy applications may be a bit more complicated and have their own nuaunces (including CCP)
 - Sometimes requires updating multiple services/systems
 - Documentation is important
