   - Consensus - Convincing others by the actions of the majority.
   - Scarcity

   - Phishing
     - Spear Phising (Specific target focused)

   - Password Spraying Attacks - Variation that focuses on a smaller set of passwords on a larger group of targets
   - Dicitonary Attacks - Predefined set of passwords to try 
   - Rainbow Tables - Same as Dictionary Attacks, but using hashes instead. 
 - Some systems password attack themselves with easy passwords to see if they can break in.
