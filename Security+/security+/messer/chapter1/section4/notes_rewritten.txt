# Cryptographic Solutions
 - Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) - Policies, proceedures, hardware and software that help create, distribute, manager, store, or revoke digital certificates
   - Involved with key creation
 - Symmetic Encryption - Single shared key for both encryption or decryption
   - Shared Secret
   - Doesn't Scale Well
   - Faster and less overhead
   - Think of a key for a door
 - Asymmetric Encryption - Two or more keys for decryption and encryption
   - Typicaly has a private key (not shared with anyone but the owner) and a public key (given away to anyone)
   - Private key is the only one that can decrypt that which is encrypted with the public key
   - Both private and Public Key created at the same time
 - key Escrow
   - Someone who holds or manages the keys
   - Allows orgs to access the encrypted data

## Encrypting Data
 - Protecting data on storage devices
   - Can be the entire system or an individual file
 - Database Encryption
   - Transparent Encryption - Encrypt with a symmetric key
   - Record Level Encryption - Encrypt individual columns w/ seperate symmetric keys for each column
 - Transport Encryption - Protect data traversing the network
   - HTTPS 
   - VPN
 - Encryption Algorithms
   - Differences are 
     - Speed
     - Security
     - Complexity
   - DES
   - AES 
   - SHA256

## Keys
 - Key Lengths
   - Larger is safer
   - Key Stretching - Re-encrypting encrypted data multiple times (for added layers)
 - Key Exchange 
   - How do you share the key without physical mediums?
   - Out-of-band - Sending the key by means of Telephone, Courier (non network)
   - In-band - Sending the key on network (typically using asymmetric encryption for sending symmetric keys)
 - Public Key Cyrptography
   - Keys are exchanged assymetrically by 
     - Person A combines their Private key with Person B's Public Key
     - Person B combines their Private key with Person A's Public Key
     - These produce the same result and allows them to have a shared key that is secure

## Encryption Technologies
 - Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
   - Cryptographic Hardware
   - Unique keys are burned in during manuf
   - Only connected to a single  device
 - Hardware Security Module (HSM)
   - Similar to TPM, but a scaled up version
   - For large environments
 - Key Management System
   - Software based
   - Can have auto key rotation
 - Secure Enclave - A protected area for our secrets focused only on secrets
   - Seperate from the CPU
   - Has its own boot ROM
   - Monitors system for alteration of boot process
   - True Random Number Generator
   - Handles Root keys
   - Real time memory encryption
 
## Obfuscation
 - Taking data nad making it harder to understand
 - Hides in plain sight
 - Easy to reverse engineer
 - Stegonography - Seucirty through obscurity
   - Message is invisible to "the naked eye"
   - Can be embeded in images, network communicaiton, files .. etc
   - Watermarks
 - Tokenization - Sensitive data replaced with a place holder (hashing)
 - Data masing - Hide part of the string (###-##-####)

## Hashing and Digital Signatures
 - Hashes - Represents data as a short string
   - One way function
   - Used for Verification
   - SHA256
 - Collision - When two different inputs create the same hash
 - Used to verify downloads
 - Used for password storage
 - Salt - Random info we add to the password before hashing
   - Everyone gets their own salt
   - Prevents rainbow tables
 - Digital Signature - Proves integrity and source (non-repudiation)
   - Creation is as follows:
     - Plaintext -> hash -> Person A applys private key to this hash -> Sends the plaintext and created encrypted hash
   - Verification is as follows:
     - Plaintext and Encrypted hash recieved -> Take encrypted hash and decrypt with Person A's public key -> Hash Plaintext using the same algo -> If they hashes are the same, then you can verify the data is right and that Person A sent the data.

## Blockchain
 - Verifiable decenteralized public ledger

## Certificates
 - Binds a public key with an identity
 - Contains other data / Details
 - Certificate Authorities combined with Certificates adds additional trust
 - X.509 is a standard
   - Serial Number
   - Version
   - Algo used
   - Name of holder
   - Public Key
   - ...
 - Allows us to verify with a trusted source
 - "Root of trust" - inherently trusted component/person (CA)
 - CA's are built into browsers and OS's
 - Verification typically happens at the CA level, if they approve, the CA signs the certificate with their private key
 - Wild Card Certificate - Used for a domain (e.g. google.com/*)
 - Key Revocation - Revoking that the certificate/key is trusted
 - OSP Stapling 
   - An online certificate status protocol that allows for easy revokation of certificates
